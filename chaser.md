Is your RSVP still correct?

## Body

Hello there.

Looks like we're going to have a packed house on Wednesday. Yay!
If you can't make it, please **update your RSVP** to No so that peeps on the waiting list can come to the meetup in your place.

Thank you!


Regards,

Caitlyn, Danielle, Justin and Steve
