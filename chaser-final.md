## Body

Hello there.

We're looking forward to the workshop tomorrow.

If you can't make it, please **update your RSVP** to No as we have a lot of people on the waiting list.

We'll have some light snacks for our mid-afternoon breaks, but recommend that you have lunch first :)

Thank you!

Regards,

Danielle, Justin and Steve
