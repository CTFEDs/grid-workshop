**Workshop: CSS layouts - Flexible boxes and Grids**

Since the web's beginnings developers have used all manner of techniques to control the layout of web pages. From tables, to floats, to `inline-block` and all manner of positioning and display properties, these techniques have all had one thing in common. They are by and large hacks.

However, with widespread browser adoption of, first, flexbox, and now in 2017 CSS grid we have modern standards for CSS layouts.

In this workshop we will learn how to use flexbox and grid for laying out web pages and components.
