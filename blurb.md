**The workshop**

Since the web's beginnings front-end developers have used all manner of techniques to control the layout of web pages. From tables, to floats, positioning, and display properties, these techniques have all had one thing in common: they are by and large hacks.

As a result design on the web has been difficult because of a lack of real tools for creating layouts. With the advent of Flexbox and latterly CSS Grid, we are finally getting tools to do design on the web. Join us for an afternoon exploring CSS Grid layouts.
