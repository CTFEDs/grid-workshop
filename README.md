**Directions**

As you enter Black River Park you will see the stairs to the entrance. Remember those :)
The visitors bays are through the booms to the right as you enter.
Once you have parked return to the stairs and enter the complex courtyard. You will see a lift on the far side of the courtyard.
Take that to the second floor and New Media Labs is directly opposite the lift as you exit. Ring the buzzer.
